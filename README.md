Description:
This lab implements a Priority Queue using a linked list in C. It simulates how operating systems manage CPU scheduling by prioritizing processes.

Files:
main.c – Test file.

pri_queue.h – Structs and function prototypes.

pri_queue.c – Your implementation goes here.

Functions to Implement:
PQ_insert(int priority, char *data) – Inserts node by priority.

PQ_delete() – Deletes and returns the highest-priority node.

How to Run
gcc main.c pri_queue.c -o pq
./pq

You should see output confirming all assertions worked.
